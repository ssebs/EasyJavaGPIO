# EasyJavaGPIO
Easy "library" for accessing GPIO with Java

If you have a raspberry pi running Arch arm and want to use Java with your GPIO like I did, this may be helpful for you.

I wasn't able to get something running easily and I had to faff around with java classpaths and I just had enough.

## What this is: 

A few files that basically send out commands to bash. (or any editor)

I am using Wiring PI's command line utility to make this. 

## To Use:

1) Install [Wiring PI](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/)

2) Add GPIOUtil.java to project

3) Compile and use it like a regular Util class.


**NOTE:**

*This is not a library*
